The aim of this project to display a system architecture, using
Vis.js. This project is also able to automatically highlight the current
used component, if combined with another project via MQTT. You can also
display your own system architecture by a syntax, which is inspired by
PlantUml.

== Installation:
* To run the project yourself you need to install NodeJs & NPM
* Then clone the Repo
* type ``npm i`` in the root directory of the project
* finally ``node index.js`` => the server should now be running at
http://localhost:8080[]

== MQTT:
* To start the MQTT Broker simply run the `start-mosquitto.sh` script located in the mosquitto-mqtt-broker
* To subscribe/publish to the Broker you need to install mosquitto-client with `snap install mqtt-explorer`
* Now you can use the Broker e.g.: `mosquitto_sub -t mqtt/test`, `mosquitto_pub -t mqtt/test -m "Hello MQTT"`
